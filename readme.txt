# Duplicate Question Finder

This project aims to identify duplicate questions on social platforms, such as Quora. Duplicate questions can clutter platforms and reduce user experience, so detecting and removing them can be valuable for maintaining a clean and organized platform.

## Overview

Duplicate questions are identified using various text similarity and machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and machine learning models to preprocess and analyze text data.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Text data is preprocessed to remove noise, including HTML tags, special characters, and contractions. Additionally, tokenization and stopword removal are performed.
- **Feature Engineering**: Various features are engineered from the text data, including common words, total words, token features, length features, and fuzzy features.
- **Visualization**: Data visualization techniques such as pair plots and dimensionality reduction (using t-SNE) are employed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
- **Modeling**: Machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, are trained to classify question pairs as duplicate or non-duplicate.
- **Web Application**: The trained model is deployed as a web application where users can input question pairs and receive predictions on whether they are duplicates.

## Dataset

The project uses the Quora Question Pairs dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data). This dataset contains pairs of questions from Quora, along with labels indicating whether they are duplicate or non-duplicate.

## Usage

To replicate or build upon this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain the Quora Question Pairs dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries and packages are installed. The necessary dependencies are listed in the code files.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by cleaning and tokenizing the text data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer relevant features from the text data to represent each question pair.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the engineered features to classify question pairs.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model, either as a standalone application or integrate it into an existing platform.
